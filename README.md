## Run It Yourself

Want to host your own server? Here's how.

### Prerequisites
You'll need a Firebase project (Realtime Database).
1.  Go to **Project Settings > Service Accounts** in Firebase Console.
2.  Generate a **Private Key** and save it as `serviceAccount.json`.
3.  Grab your Database URL from the Realtime Database section.

### Local Development

1.  Clone the repo and drop your `serviceAccount.json` in the root folder.
2.  Create a `.env` file:
    ```env
    FIREBASE_DB_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./serviceAccount.json
    ```
3.  Run it:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
4.  Connect in a new tab:
    ```bash
    ssh -p 2324 localhost
    ```

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 2324:2324 \
  -e FIREBASE_DB_URL="https://YOUR-DB-URL.firebaseio.com" \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/app/serviceAccount.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/serviceAccount.json:/app/serviceAccount.json" \
  ghcr.io/aminshahid573/termplay:latest
```
